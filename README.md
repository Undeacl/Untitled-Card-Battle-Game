# üÉè Untitled Card Battle Game

![](https://github.com/Undeacl/Untitled-Game/blob/main/Images/Untitled%20Game%20Preview.gif)  

A strategic **card-based RPG game** inspired by [Balatro](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379780/Balatro/) and [The Demon Hand](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/game-updates/the-demons-hand/) built with **Python** and **Pygame**. Players use a deck of cards to attack enemies, build combos, and progress through a dynamic map filled with encounters, rests, mini-bosses, and bosses.

## üìù What I Learned
Through building this game, I furthered my experience in:  
- **Pygame basics:** Handling sprites, animations, and events.  
- **Object-Oriented Programming:** Structuring the game with classes like `Card`, `Character`, and `Map`.  
- **Game Logic:** Implementing card combos, turn-based mechanics, and enemy AI.  
- **UI Design:** Creating interactive buttons and visual feedback for damage and combos.  
- **Project Organization:** Managing multiple Python modules, assets, and global variables efficiently.  
- **Debugging & Optimization:** Fixing animation timing, preventing selection conflicts, and handling sprite updates efficiently.
